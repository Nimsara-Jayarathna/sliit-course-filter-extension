# ✨ SLIIT CourseWeb Extension - Enhanced UI Edition

This is a special version of the SLIIT CourseWeb Extension focused on providing a **fluid, premium user experience** and a **cleaner, distraction-free LMS interface**.

> 🚀 **Current Branch:** `feature/visual-smoothing`

---

## 🎨 Key Differences in This Version

Unlike the standard version, this edition introduces significant UI/UX improvements:

### 1. 🌊 Fluid & Smooth Menu Animations
The Global Navigation Menu opens and closes with smooth, high-frame-rate transitions. No more jarring pop-ins. The interactions feel native and polished.

### 2. 🧹 Cleaned LMS Page Interface
We don't just add a menu; we clean up the mess. This version actively removes:
-   Cluttered dashboard widgets.
-   Redundant banners and spacing.
-   Distracting elements from the course pages.
Resulting in a **focused, minimalist learning environment**.

### 3. 🛡️ Robust API Integration
Like the main version, it uses the Moodle API to fetch all courses (hidden/past), but with optimized caching for smoother rendering matching the new UI animations.
